==================
Development - Core
==================

The core which resides in ``bin/smarthome.py`` is the heart of the system. The core needs
a couple of libraries which are located in ``lib``. Part of them is for exclusive use by ``bin/smarthome.py``, 
why they are considered core libraries.

The main object which is in instance of the class defined in ``bin/smarthome.py``, 
is accessible and named  ``sh`` in most contexts. From time to time it is referred to as
``_sh`` or ``smarthome``. 

The functionallity of the core can be extended by the use of loadable modules. a description of the
module system follows below.

The libraries listed here provide the extra functionality for the core.
More info upon the functions and their parameters can be found here.
