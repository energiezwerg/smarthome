Multi-Language Support
======================

This documentation is valid vor SmartHomeNG versions beyond v1.4.2. It does not work on v1.4.2
and below.

Words or phrases in the webinterface can be marked for translation. 


Marking text for translation
----------------------------

To mark a word or phrase for translation, it has to be part of a Jinja1 expression (it ha to 
be included in ``{{ ... }}``).

Within the Jinja2 expression, the word/phrase must be included in ``_( ... )``.

The word/phrase to be translated can be read from a variable or can be specified as a constant text.
A constant text, has to be included in quotes (``'...')``.

So, if you have a a prompt in the webinterface like this:

.. code-block:: HTML
   :caption: Example for `plugin/webif/templates/index.html`

	<td class="py-1"><strong>Service für den KNX Support</strong></td>


you can mark it for translation by marking it as a Jinja2 expression and the string as a
constant string to be translated:

.. code-block:: HTML
   :caption: Example with translation markup for `plugin/webif/templates/index.html`

	<td class="py-1"><strong>{{ _('Service für den KNX Support') }}</strong></td>


How translation works
---------------------

The translation is a multi-step process. The translation of the text (word/phrase) is:

   1. searched for in the working language of SmartHomeNG in the plugins's translation file
   2. If not found, the translation is searched for in the working language in the global translation file
   3. If not found, the translation is searched for in 'English' in the plugins's translation file
   4. If not found, the translation is searched for in 'English' in the global translation file
   5. If not found, the text is returned unaltered. In this case, a log entry of severity INFO is
      created, logging the missing translation.
   
The plugins's translation file is called **locale.yaml** and is stored in the plugin's directory.

The global translation file, which holds translations (mostly for single words) that are used in
several plugins,is called **locale.yaml** too and is stored in the **bin** directory of SmartHomeNG.


Adding translations/languages
-----------------------------

In the translation files, for each text to be translated a dict structure is defined in the section 
``plugin_translations:``:

.. code-block:: YAML
   :caption: Example a translation

   plugin_translations:
       # Translations for the plugin specially for the web interface
       'Schließen':         {'de': '=', 'en': 'Close'}

The equal-sign in the translation for German signals that the key **Wert 2** is the right translation.
It makes the translation process stop looking for translations and prevents the log entry.

Further languages can be added, using the appropriate language code, followed by the translation text:

.. code-block:: YAML
   :caption: Example of a translation

   plugin_translations:
       # Translations for the plugin specially for the web interface
       'Schließen':         {'de': '=', 'en': 'Close', 'fr': 'Fermer'}
