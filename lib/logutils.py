    This class builds a filter to be used in logging.yaml to configure logging
    Since Python 3.2 it only needs to provide a filter function taking a 
    LogRecord object as argument.
    The filter function here will remember module, levelno and msg of the 
    current record until next call. If a record immediately following provides
    the same entries, then it won't be displayed.
    It is useful to suppress the generation of huge logs due to a non captured 
    error that is only of time limited nature such as connection problems to
    other devices.
    This will however not work if there are two interchanging records.
    The size of a logfile should then be limited as a seconds measurement
